    """Random Walk Sampler -- inherits from the VanillaSampling base class.

    Follows the method laid out in the FastDownward planning system for conducting state samples:
    - https://github.com/aibasel/downward/blob/main/src/search/task_utils/sampling.cc

    Taken from the FastDownward planning system:
        The walk length is taken from a binomial distribution centered around the
        estimated plan length, which is computed as the ratio of the h value of
        the initial state divided by the average operator costs. Whenever a dead
        end is detected or a state has no successors, restart from the initial
        state. The 'init_h' value should be an estimate of the solution cost.

    Attributes:
        max_time(float):
            The maximum time allowed for a trace to be generated.
        init_h(int):
            Initial estimate of the cost to the goal.
        num_traces (int):
            The number of traces to be generated.
        traces (TraceList):
            The list of traces generated.
