    The CSV file should have the following properties:

    - An action column that contains the action names.
    - Fluent columns with cells containing 0 or 1.
    - (optionally) A plan ID column that contains the plan ID to separate the traces.

    Args:
        fname (str):
            The name of the trace file to load.
        act_col (str):
            The name of the column in the trace file that contains the action names.
        plan_id_col (str, optional):

            Defaults to None.

            The loaded trace list.
