    """SLAF model extraction method.

    Amir, E, and A Chang. 2008. “Learning Partially Observable Deterministic Action Models.”
    Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 33: 349–402. https://doi.org/10.1613/jair.2575.

    Extracts a Model from state observations using the SLAF technique. The AS-STRIPS-SLAF
    algorithm is used to extract the effects of actions given a trace/observation. The algorithm
    is incapable of finding the preconditions of those actions, however.

    Note that SLAF learns partially observable, deterministic action models, and thus takes
    PartialObservation as the token type.

    The AS-STRIPS-SLAF algorithm works by defining "action propositions" for each action that define
    the possible preconditions, effects, or lack-thereof of that action and every possible fluent. A
    propositional formula is updated as each step is iterated through, and kept in a "fluent-factored form"
    that specifies the possible "explanations" behind each fluent being true, false, or unaffected. As actions
    are taken and states observed, these reasonings are updated and simplified. (Note that the pieces of the formula
    are stored carefully so as to easily conjoin them into one CNF formula later). Once all steps in the trace
    have been iterated through, the CNF formula is created, and all possible fluents/action propositions are
    iterated through to determine which ones are entailed. This information is then used to extract the Model.
