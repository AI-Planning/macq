This library is a collection of tools for planning-like action model acquisition from state trace data. It contains a reimplementation from many existing works, and generalizes some of them to new settings.

## Example Usage

```python
from macq import generate, extract
from macq.observation import IdentityObservation, AtomicPartialObservation

# get a domain-specific generator: uses api.planning.domains problem_id/
# generate 100 traces of length 20 using vanilla sampling
traces = generate.pddl.VanillaSampling(problem_id = 123, plan_len = 20, num_traces = 100).traces

traces.generate_more(10)

action = traces[0][0].action
traces.get_usage(action)
# [0.05, 0.05, ..., 0.05]

trace = traces[0]
len(trace)
# 20

trace.fluents
trace.actions
trace.get_pre_states(action) # get the state before each occurance of action
trace.get_post_states(action) # state after each occurance of action
trace.get_total_cost()
```

## Survey

You can find the full scope of papers considered in the survey (implemented and otherwise) at http://macq.planning.domains . This repository of model acquisition techniques will be added to over time.
